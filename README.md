this repository is intended to create a learning by excercises platform.

the penultimate goal is to replace classroom learning completely, but that's a long way off, hence the term "penultimate".

The less ultimate goal is to provide a platform for users to create their own online tutorials. Probably first just for apps, and then, gradually add subjects beyond computer science. This would be really awesome, and it's very ambitious, but I think our education system is outdated. There are a lot of tools that we don't take full advantage of, and I think this could be the future.

So, if you're interested, fork me! And we can create some cool stuff together.

Just a little background information about the project:

It uses the [MEAN stack](https://github.com/linnovate/mean), which is just MongoDB (as the database), Express (as the server), Angular (as the front end), and Node (for everything else). Mean has a bit of a learning curve, but if you already know these technologies, it shouldn't take you too long.

Mongo is super easy. You don't even really need to study this, but there are some great resources on [their website](http://try.mongodb.org/?_ga=1.5633397.753444883.1423159000), and the [examples](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/tree/master/examples) are pretty readable.

Express is just the server. You can get the gist of it [here](http://expressjs.com/guide/routing.html).

Angular is one of the most challenging fourths of this particular acronym. I pretty much just went through the [O'Reilly examples on github](https://github.com/shyamseshadri/angularjs-book).

Node is IMHO the hardest part, but made somewhat easier in [Node Schoole](http://nodeschool.io). They also have some great tools to make you a javascript ninja.

Once you know all that (shouldn't take you more than a few days), we bring it all together with [MEAN](http://mean.io). Resources on that [here](http://learn.mean.io).

Once you've conquered all that, why don't we meet back here and regroup?
